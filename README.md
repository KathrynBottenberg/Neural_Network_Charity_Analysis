# Neural Network Charity Analysis
Overview of the analysis: 
In this analysis, we are tasked with creating a binary classifier, neural network, which is capable of predicting whether applicants will be successful if funded by Alphabet Soup, a company which raises money to invest and fund foundations that are aim to improve the world. They have provided us with a CSV containing more than 34,000 organizations that have received funding from Alphabet Soup over the years. The csv file contains the following variables:
- **EIN** and **NAME**—Identification columns
- **APPLICATION_TYPE**—Alphabet Soup application type
- **AFFILIATION**—Affiliated sector of industry
- **CLASSIFICATION**—Government organization classification
- **USE_CASE**—Use case for funding
- **ORGANIZATION**—Organization type
- **STATUS**—Active status
- **INCOME_AMT**—Income classification
- **SPECIAL_CONSIDERATIONS**—Special consideration for application
- **ASK_AMT**—Funding amount requested
- **IS_SUCCESSFUL**—Was the money used effectively

Deliverable 1: Preprocessing Data for a Neural Network Model
Deliverable 2: Compile, Train, and Evaluate the Model
Deliverable 3: Optimize the Model


Results: Using bulleted lists and images to support your answers, address the following questions.
Data Preprocessing
What variable(s) are considered the target(s) for your model?
What variable(s) are considered to be the features for your model?
What variable(s) are neither targets nor features, and should be removed from the input data?
Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model
How many neurons, layers, and activation functions did you select for your neural network model, and why?
Were you able to achieve the target model performance?
What steps did you take to try and increase model performance?

Summary: Summarize the overall results of the deep learning model. Include a recommendation for how a different model could solve this classification problem, and explain your recommendation.
